          Myth: Hormones are used for the rapid growth of chicken
        </h5>
        <h5 class="ms-5 mt-3">FACT</h5>
        <p class="text-loght text-center mt-2 p-5">
          The addition of hormones is strictly prohibited by government regulation. Hormones costs
          high which are not economical for the breeders with the selling price of chicken.
          Furthermore, it would hurt birds and affect flock performance to pick up each bird and
          inject. Using hormones on chickens is logically not possible..

          If chickens aren’t genetically modified, then how do they get so big?
        </h5>
        <h5 class="ms-5 mt-3">FACT</h5>
        <p class="text-loght text-center mt-2 p-5">
          The answer is simple–selective breeding. It’s the process of identifying which chickens
          are the strongest and healthiest – and then they are bred together Breeding farms are
          equipped with the right technologies to create continuous small improvements in each
          generation. The result of decades of breeding birds is the larger and healthier birds that
          you see today.

        <h5 class="text-success ms-5 mt-3">Myth: Chicken causes early puberty in girls</h5>
        <h5 class="ms-5 mt-3">FACT</h5>
        <p class="text-loght text-center mt-2 p-5">
          It’s because of positive energy balance i.e.input energy is greater than output energy
          nowadays. In the early days, there was less nutritional diet among people but work was
          more. But now adequate and balanced healthy diet during all phases of growth(infancy,
          childhood, puberty) appears necessary for both growth and normal pubertal development.
          less energy output, lack of activities among children.e.g.video games, mobile addiction is
          leading to the immobility of children .these are the causes of early maturity, not the
          food items. Myth: Does the chicken I buy have antibiotic residue in it?

        <p class="text-loght text-center mt-2 p-5">
          All chicken you buy is technically “antibiotic-free” – federal rules require that if any
          antibiotics are used on a farm they must have cleared the animals’ systems before they can
          leave the farm. GET I
